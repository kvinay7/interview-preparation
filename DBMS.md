# Database Management System

## Data and Information
 - **Data**: Raw, unorganized facts that by themselves may have no meaning. Data becomes meaningful only when processed.
 - **Information**: Processed data that is meaningful and useful for decision-making.
 - **Example**: Consider the string “orange”. Here, it could mean a color or a fruit. This term “orange” is data. However, if we say “color orange” or “fruit orange”, it becomes information.

## Database
A structured collection of related data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
- Example: A table of students with fields like ID, Name, Marks.
- Characteristics:
  - Organized using tables
  - Supports relationships between entities
  - Supports queries and transactions
